How the Game Works
Setup: The game starts by prompting the user to enter the number of players and the target score. Each player's score is initialized to 0.

Gameplay: Players take turns rolling two six-sided dice. The values rolled on the dice are added together to determine the player's score for that turn.

Tupled Out: If a player rolls a pair of matching dice (a 'tupled out' scenario), their score for that turn becomes 0.

Re-rolling Dice: After the initial roll, players have the option to re-roll any of the dice. This can be done multiple times until the player chooses not to re-roll.

Winning the Game: The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the target score. The player who achieves this is declared the winner.
